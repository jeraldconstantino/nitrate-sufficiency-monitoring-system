<h1 align="center">Nitrate Sufficiency Monitoring System</h1>
The system is primarily designed for monitoring and classifying the nitrate sufficiency of an aquaponic system based on the morphological features of the lettuce. It is deployed on a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B device. The software has been developed using the PyQt5 library and is integrated with a deep learning model that utilizes the [Ultralytic YOLO algorithm](https://docs.ultralytics.com/modes/) to perform live video feed classification and segmentation tasks.
